# Vagrant Lab for Windows

This project uses Vagrant and Parallels to create a small lab consisting of an ansoble control node (named control)
and some number of of Windows and/or Linux nodes.

## SSH Authentication Agent

The included Vagrantfile enables SSH proxy forwarding so clustered products that use OpenSSH to
communicate (Ansible, GPFS, etc.) dont have to perform additional key management. There is an included script
that triggers on `vagrant up` which adds the ssh keys used by Vagrant to the agent automatically. The user
is responsible for making sure that `ssh-agent` is running

### ssh-agent on macOS

macOS already comes with ssh-agent support. To ensure that the agent is started on login:

```
launchctl enable gui/$(id -u)/com.openssh.ssh-agent
```

Thereafter `ssh-add` can be used to add keys to the runing agent configuration.

## Known Defects

The Ansible inventory, including `wiondows` and `linux` groups should be generated by Vagrant on `vagrant up`.
